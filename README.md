# AMAZON-FOOD-REVIEWS

This repository contains the code for analysing food reviews from Amazon. This was an academic group project.

A data set of text reviews and corresponding ratings provided by users is used in this project (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html). The rating scores range from 1 (lowest rating) to 5 (highest rating).

Using text analytics techniques, the data is analysed for insights and a categorization system is created to automatically rate similar text reviews.

The following steps were performed:

1. Data Exploration and Visualization
2. Text Processing and Normalization
3. Vector Space Model and Feature Representation
4. Model Training, Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning and Evaluation
5. Topic Modelling of high and low ratings
